Data science is probably the most popular concept nowadays. I believe that many people are looking for an entrance to get inside the industry, and I just happened to read an article that lists some great data science books that may be helpful for you. So I concluded it in this article and I’ve also given the books brief introductions, so you can choose the ones you’d like to read. Some of the data science books you can find it online, and I've given out the links. But most of them I think you may need to find them on Amazon.
